# SPcodes Lab Collection

This repository contains a series of C/C++ programs and input files for various system programming (SP) lab assignments. Each lab demonstrates a different concept in system programming, such as symbol tables, macro processors, assemblers, linkers, and loaders.

## Folder Structure

- **lab1_SymbolTable.cpp**: Implementation of a symbol table.
- **lab1input.c**: Input file for Lab 1.
- **lab2_MACRO.cpp**: Implementation of a basic macro processor.
- **lab2input.c**: Input file for Lab 2.
- **lab3_macroWithParameter.cpp**: Macro processor supporting parameters.
- **lab3input.c**: Input file for Lab 3.
- **lab4_Assembler.cpp**: Implementation of a simple assembler.
- **lab4input.asm**: Assembly input file for Lab 4.
- **lab5_Linker.cpp**: Implementation of a linker.
- **lab6_Loader.cpp**: Implementation of a loader.
- **lab6input.obj**: Object file input for Lab 6.

## Executables

Each lab's corresponding `.exe` file is the compiled output of the respective `.cpp` source file.

## How to Use

1. **Compile** the `.cpp` files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, or MSVC).
2. **Run** the executables, providing the appropriate input files as needed.
3. **Review** the output for each lab to understand the underlying system programming concept.

## Labs Overview

- **Lab 1**: Symbol Table implementation for assembler.
- **Lab 2**: Macro processor (basic).
- **Lab 3**: Macro processor with parameter support.
- **Lab 4**: Simple assembler.
- **Lab 5**: Linker.
- **Lab 6**: Loader.
